    Description:
    
    The energy market is confronted with several critical issues that must be addressed immediately. In this setting, renewable energy seems to be thriving; however, a quick response is needed to keep the grid intact. Grid managers, consumers, and entrepreneurs are attempting to use AI to achieve optimal energy use as we move into the fourth industrial revolution.AI has the potential to unleash a variety of options for more effective energy use, which would help both suppliers and end consumers. 
    AI-managed smart devices create a channel between various components like appliances and end-users to react to any hazard or emergency. This information layer, which was developed because of the widespread implementation of smart meters and sensors, enables data gathering, storing, and interpretation. And by having efficient prediction capabilities, AI can be used to boost market forecasting and utilisation consumption.
